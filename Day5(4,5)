1)Study more details on state concept.   
Ans:
state can be modified based on user action or network changes
Every time the state of an object changes, React re-renders the component to the browser
The state object is initialized in the constructor
The state object can store multiple properties
this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object
setState() function performs a shallow merge between the new and the previous state

2)What are the differnces between state and props in react js?

Props in ReactJS:
Props, short for "properties," are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.
They are similar to function arguments in that they allow you to pass values from one component to another. 
Props are immutable, which means that once they are passed to a component, they cannot be changed.

State in ReactJS:
State represents the internal state of a component. It's an object that stores data that can be changed within the component.
State should only be used for data that is specific to a component and can't be computed from props. 
when the state of a component changes, React will re-render the component and its children.
